                    If you still have eyes after looking at the abomination right in front of you,
                    you can see the legendary self-portrait of myself done by me. It was the first exercise
                    in the book
                    <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-300 duration-100" href="https://www.drawright.com/">Drawing on the Right Side of the brain by Betty Edwards</a>.
                    I suppose it was an attempt at putting you straight into the deep end of drawing.
                    In an age when social media is filled with beautiful real (or AI) art with perfect technique.
                    I can comfortably share with people my horrible drawings instead. I'm sure others who feel
                    discouraged by not being good at drawing can feel soothed. Who knows? Maybe I'll become a great artist
                    and this drawing will be proof that talent does not exist.

                    If your question was instead aimed at this website, well....damn I didn't think my SEO would
                    be so good to catch you boys in here. I thought google had become a hellscape, how did you find this thing?
                    Well, no worries. It's not really that interesting. It's a small personal project for a computer student out
                    of a desperate need to convince recruiters to hire him. That's really all!

                    As for who I am, Hi, I am Amirhossein, The name's hard to pronounce so I go with Amasirat online.
                    I do many things but I am a programmer/Computer Scientist, if you'd like to box me into
                    a singular social identity. That's what I'm studying at university so I suppose that's fair!
